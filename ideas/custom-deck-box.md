# 💡 Vision
A robust, custom-designed 3D printed deck box tailored to fit my specific card sleeves perfectly. Unlike generic boxes, this will minimize "deck rattle" and potentially feature a locking mechanism or display window for a commander/leader card.

# 🔬 Research & Tech Stack
* **Hardware:** Bambu Lab P1S (likely printing in PLA+ or PETG for durability).
* **Software:** CAD (Onshape or Fusion 360) for parametric design.
* **Key Components:** * Card Sleeves (Dragon Shield? Katana? - Need specific brand for tolerances).
    * Magnets (6x2mm or 6x3mm) for the lid closure.

# 📝 Notes & Links
* *Design Constraint:* Need to account for the "puff" factor (air trapped in newly sleeved cards) vs. compressed thickness.
* *Idea:* Add a separate compartment for dice/tokens.
* *Inspiration:* [Search for "Rugged Box" mechanisms on Printables]

# 🚧 Blockers & Next Steps
* [ ] **Constraint:** Don't have the sleeves yet, so I can't determine the internal dimensions (width/height/depth).
* [ ] **Action Item:** Order sleeves.
* [ ] **Action Item:** Once arrived, use calipers to measure the full deck thickness (compressed vs. loose) to set CAD parameters.
