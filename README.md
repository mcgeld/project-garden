# 🏡 Project Garden

**Status:** Maintained
**Purpose:** Project Lifecycle Management & Research Archive

## 📖 About
This repository serves as the single source of truth for my engineering projects, hardware builds, and creative ideas. It is designed to solve "Project Amnesia" by decoupling the *documentation* of a project from the *code* of the project.

## 🗂 Structure
* **🌱 Ideas (`/ideas`)**: The "Seed Bank." Research, feasibility checks, and tech stack plans for projects I haven't started yet.
* **🌿 Active (`/active`)**: The "Greenhouse." Living documentation for the 1-2 projects currently in flight.
* **🌳 Library (`/library`)**: The "Arboretum." Post-mortems, runbooks, and links to source code for finished or retired projects.
